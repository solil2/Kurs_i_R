# R_grunnkurs
This repository contains course material for SSBs introductory course in R. The material is part of a course held for internal users at SSB. 
It contains example code and practice datasets, exercises and solutions for the course held in two sessions over two days. 

For SSB wrokers, videos of the online course are availble for watching on Stream with links below

Part 1: **Introduction to R**
What is R and why do we use it in SSB? How do we start R and what is an object and a vector? [Introduction to R](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/8846dced-ca77-449a-a927-b36c4caa53cb)

Part 2: **Reading in data**
Data can come in a whole range of formats. In this part we show a few methods for reading in data such as SAS datasets, from csv and from Statbank tables. [Video on reading in data to R](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/a0a48bc0-fa74-48a0-bd2d-c587f67a24da)

Part 3: **Data handling**
Perhaps the most time consuming part of data analysis is getting the data into the right form. Here we use tidyverse to create and format variables, filter and group data and create summary statistics.

Part 4: **Visualizing data**
Here we describe how to join datasets together and visuslaize the results. We create figures with the tidyverse function ggplot. [Video on Visualizing data](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/3a01c023-2653-4e3d-9455-4303d59a0280)
